\f0\fs20 \cf0 ## Task List\
* Rapid prototype levels\
* Create/add placeholder music\
* Create level blocks for "bonus" levels\
* Create level blocks for "cave" levels\
* Implement "breakable" behavior [BROKEN]\
\
## Crashes\
* Crashes when touching start point in 1-3.tmx?\
\
## Other Problems\
* Hitting a toggle switch only changes that one switch; others need to be changed as well or else level design must take discrepancy into account\
* For some reason, breakable blocks directly underneath the starting position are triggered immediately\
* Root cause of above - a collision is immediately triggered when the simulation starts with whatever is below the ball - maybe funked up gravity? Tried setting initial gravity to zero, but of course that means the ball doesn't move until the user touches the screen}
